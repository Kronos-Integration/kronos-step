== Step Interface
Describes the step interface. Each step need to implement the methods of this step interface.


=== Step Attributes

name::
Returns the name of the step. For the 'raw' step as it will be registered at the kronos-manager the name will
be the same as the type.

endpoints::
Returns an object with all the endpoints of this step.

[source,js]
----
{
	"name1" : endpoint1,
}
----

=== Step Methods

start::
Starts the step. If a step is started it is able to retrieve requests over its endpoints.
The start method will return a Promise with the step itself after it is fullfiled.

stop::
Stops a step. When a step will be stopped it should disable the inbound endpoints first. So no new request
could come in.

isRunning::
Returns a true value if the step is running. This means it is not stopped.


toString::


toJSON::
	Returns the JSON representation of the step


== Step Factory Interface
This interface is used to create new steps. The object registered at the manager must implement
the step factory interface.

=== Step Factory Attributes

name::
Returns the name of the step factory. This name is used to register the step factory at the manager.


=== Step Factory Methods


getInstance::
This function creates a new instance of this step. This method is used if a flow needs step instances.
